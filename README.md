# Smart Contract Auditing Toolkit for Stacks Blockchain

## Overview

The Smart Contract Auditing Toolkit is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to help developers and auditors analyze, test, and verify Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. This toolkit provides automated vulnerability scanning, gas analysis, type checking, and symbolic execution capabilities to ensure your smart contracts are secure and optimized.

## Features

### Core Features
- 🔍 Automated vulnerability detection
- ⚡ Gas usage analysis and optimization
- 📝 Static type checking
- 🔄 Symbolic execution
- 📊 Comprehensive reporting
- 🚀 Performance optimization suggestions

### Vulnerability Detection
- Unauthorized access patterns
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Unchecked transfers
- Reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Unsafe unwrap operations
- Unbounded loops
- Centralization risks
- Complex state dependencies
- Race conditions

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stacks-audit-toolkit.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd stacks-audit-toolkit

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```python
from stacks_audit_toolkit.analyzer import ClarityAnalyzer
from stacks_audit_toolkit.utils import load_contract, generate_report

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = ClarityAnalyzer()

# Load and analyze a contract
contract_code = load_contract("path/to/your/contract.clar")
results = await analyzer.analyze_contract(contract_code, deep_analysis=True)

# Generate and print the report
report = generate_report(results)
print(report)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration

```python
# Initialize with custom configuration
analyzer = ClarityAnalyzer({
    'vulnerability_checks': ['reentrancy', 'overflow', 'unsafe_unwrap'],
    'gas_analysis': True,
    'type_checking': True,
    'symbolic_execution': True
})
```

### Gas Analysis

```python
# Perform detailed gas analysis
gas_results = await analyzer.gas_analyzer.analyze(contract_code)
optimization_suggestions = await analyzer.gas_analyzer.suggest_optimizations(contract_code)
```

### Type Checking

```python
# Run static type analysis
type_results = await analyzer.type_checker.check(contract_code)
```

## Analysis Reports

The toolkit generates comprehensive reports including:

- Detailed vulnerability findings with severity levels
- Gas usage analysis and optimization suggestions
- Type checking results
- Symbolic execution paths
- Code quality metrics
- Optimization recommendations

Example report structure:
```json
{
    "vulnerabilities": [
        {
            "type": "reentrancy",
            "severity": "HIGH",
            "line": 42,
            "description": "Potential reentrancy vulnerability in transfer function",
            "mitigation": "Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern"
        }
    ],
    "gas_analysis": {
        "high_gas_patterns": [...],
        "optimization_suggestions": [...]
    },
    "type_analysis": {
        "errors": [],
        "warnings": []
    }
}
```
